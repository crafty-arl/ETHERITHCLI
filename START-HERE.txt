🚀 QUICK START - INSTALLATION IN 4 STEPS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

  Step 1: Double-click "install.bat" in this folder

  Step 2: Follow the on-screen instructions
          (The installer does everything automatically!)

  Step 3: RESTART YOUR COMPUTER when installation finishes
          ⚠️ This is REQUIRED! Node.js won't work without restarting.

  Step 4: Double-click "install.bat" AGAIN after restart
          (If Node.js was just installed, you need to run the
           installer again to complete the Etherith installation)
