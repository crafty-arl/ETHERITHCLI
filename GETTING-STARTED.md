## Installation - 4 Easy Steps

### Step 1: Download Etherith

You should already have the Etherith files in a folder on your computer.
If you're reading this file, you're in the right place! üéâ

### Step 2: Run the Installer (First Time)

1. **Find the file called `install.bat`** in the Etherith folder
2. **Double-click `install.bat`** to start the installation
3. **Follow the on-screen instructions** - the installer will guide you through everything

![Installation Tip](https://via.placeholder.com/15/00ff00/000000?text=+) **The installer will:**
- Check if you have Node.js (and install it if needed)
- Set up your computer to run Etherith
- Install Etherith so you can use it anywhere

**Time required:** 5-10 minutes (mostly waiting for downloads)

### Step 3: Restart Your Computer (Important!)

**IF the installer installed Node.js:**
1. **Close all windows**
2. **Restart your computer**
3. **Wait for your computer to fully boot up**

**Why restart?** This ensures Node.js is properly recognized by your computer. Windows needs a fresh start to add Node.js to your system.

### Step 4: Run the Installer Again (After Restart)

**IF you restarted your computer:**
1. **Go back to the Etherith folder**
2. **Double-click `install.bat` AGAIN**
3. **This time it will install Etherith** (much faster, 1-2 minutes)

**Why twice?** The first run installs Node.js, the second run installs Etherith. If Node.js was already on your computer, you only need to run it once!

![Installation Tip](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffff00/000000?text=+) **The installer will tell you** if you need to restart and run it again. Just follow the on-screen messages!
