## Installation Questions

### Q: Do I need to restart my computer after installing?

**A: YES! And you need to run install.bat AGAIN after restarting.**

This is **very important** if Node.js was just installed:

**The Complete Process:**
1. Run `install.bat` (first time)
2. If Node.js gets installed, the installer will tell you to restart
3. **Restart your computer** completely
4. **Run `install.bat` AGAIN** (second time - this installs Etherith)
5. Now Etherith is ready to use!

**Why restart?**
- Windows needs a restart to recognize Node.js
- Node.js must be in your system PATH before Etherith can be installed
- Without restarting, Etherith installation will fail

**Why run install.bat twice?**
- First run: Installs Node.js (if needed)
- Restart: Activates Node.js
- Second run: Installs Etherith

**Don't worry!** The second install is much faster (1-2 minutes) and the installer clearly tells you what to do.

### Q: Do I need to run install.bat twice?

**A: Only if Node.js wasn't already on your computer.**

**Scenario 1: Node.js already installed**
- Run `install.bat` once
- Everything installs in one go
- Ready to use after install completes!

**Scenario 2: Node.js NOT installed (most common for new users)**
- Run `install.bat` ‚Üí Installs Node.js
- Restart computer ‚Üí Activates Node.js
- Run `install.bat` again ‚Üí Installs Etherith
- Now ready to use!

**The installer will tell you** which scenario applies and what to do next. Just follow the on-screen instructions!

### Q: How long does installation take?

**A: About 5-10 minutes total (or 10-15 if Node.js needs to be installed).**

**First-time installation (with Node.js):**
- First run of install.bat: 5-8 minutes
- Restart computer: 2-3 minutes
- Second run of install.bat: 1-2 minutes
- **Total: 10-15 minutes**

**If Node.js already installed:**
- Run install.bat: 5-10 minutes
- **Total: 5-10 minutes**

If it's taking much longer, check your internet connection or see TROUBLESHOOTING.md.

### Q: What is Node.js and why do I need it?

**A: Node.js is free software that Etherith needs to run.**

Think of it like this:
- **Etherith** = your car
- **Node.js** = the engine

Without Node.js, Etherith can't work. But don't worry:
- ‚úÖ It's completely free
- ‚úÖ It's safe (from nodejs.org)
- ‚úÖ The installer adds it automatically
- ‚úÖ Millions of people use it worldwide

### Q: Do I need to be an administrator to install?

**A: It helps, but it's not always required.**

**If the regular installation fails:**
1. Right-click on `install.bat`
2. Choose "Run as administrator"
3. Click "Yes" when Windows asks permission

### Q: Can I install on a laptop? On multiple computers?

**A: Yes to both!**

- ‚úÖ **Laptops**: Works perfectly on laptops
- ‚úÖ **Multiple computers**: Install on as many computers as you want
- ‚úÖ **Desktops**: Works on all Windows desktops

Each computer needs its own installation, but your files on IPFS are accessible from anywhere!

### Q: Do I need internet to install?

**A: Yes, for installation. No, for some features after.**

**During installation:**
- ‚úÖ Internet required - Downloads Node.js and Etherith files

**After installation:**
- ‚úÖ Internet required - Uploading files to IPFS
- ‚úÖ Internet required - Searching files
- ‚ùå Internet not required - Viewing files you've already downloaded

## Using Etherith Questions

### Q: Where do I type Etherith commands?

**A: In the Command Prompt (the black window).**

**How to open Command Prompt:**
1. Press the Windows key on your keyboard
2. Type: `cmd`
3. Press Enter
4. A black window opens - that's the Command Prompt!

**Then type Etherith commands** like:
```
etherith --help
etherith init "My Family Archive"
```

### Q: Why use Command Prompt instead of double-clicking?

**A: Etherith is a "command-line" tool.**

It's designed to be used by typing commands, which gives you more control and power. Think of it like:
- **Point-and-click apps** = automatic transmission car (easier, less control)
- **Command-line tools** = manual transmission car (more control, more powerful)

Don't worry - we give you exact commands to type!

### Q: Can I use PowerShell instead of Command Prompt?

**A: Yes, but you might need to run fix-powershell.bat first.**

- **Command Prompt (cmd)** - Works immediately, no setup needed ‚úÖ
- **PowerShell** - Needs configuration first, then works fine ‚úÖ

If you get a "scripts disabled" error in PowerShell:
1. Find `fix-powershell.bat` in the Etherith folder
2. Double-click it
3. PowerShell will now work!

### Q: What happens to my files when I upload them?

**A: They're stored permanently on IPFS (a global network).**

Here's what happens:
1. You run `etherith add "photo.jpg"`
2. Etherith uploads your photo to IPFS (decentralized storage)
3. You get a permanent link (like a URL)
4. Your photo is now stored on thousands of computers worldwide
5. It can never be deleted or lost!

**Important:**
- ‚úÖ Files last forever
- ‚úÖ Accessible from anywhere
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Files are PUBLIC - anyone with the link can see them
- ‚ùå Don't upload private/sensitive information

### Q: How much does it cost to use Etherith?

**A: Etherith is completely FREE!**

- ‚úÖ **Free to install**
- ‚úÖ **Free to use**
- ‚úÖ **Free file storage on IPFS**
- ‚úÖ **No hidden fees**
- ‚úÖ **No subscriptions**
- ‚úÖ **No limits on files**

IPFS storage is free because it's a decentralized network maintained by the community.

### Q: Is there a limit to how many files I can upload?

**A: No official limit!**

However:
- ‚úÖ Upload as many files as you want
- ‚úÖ Each file can be quite large (we recommend under 100MB per file)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Very large files (over 100MB) might take a long time to upload
- üí° **Tip**: For videos, consider compressing them first

### Q: Can I delete files after uploading?

**A: No - files on IPFS are permanent.**

This is actually a FEATURE, not a bug:
- ‚úÖ Your family memories can never be lost
- ‚úÖ Files survive even if your computer dies
- ‚úÖ Future generations can access them

‚ö†Ô∏è **That's why we warn**: Only upload files you're okay with being public and permanent!

### Q: Can I organize files into folders?

**A: Yes! Using tags and descriptions.**

While Etherith doesn't use traditional folders, you can organize files:

**By Tags:**
```
etherith add "photo1.jpg" --tags "wedding,1995,mom,dad"
etherith add "photo2.jpg" --tags "graduation,2010,sister"
```

**By Description:**
```
etherith add "photo.jpg" --description "Grandma's 80th birthday party"
```

**Then search by tag or keyword:**
```
etherith search "wedding"
etherith search "grandma"
```

## Technical Questions (For Curious Users)

### Q: What is IPFS?

**A: InterPlanetary File System - a decentralized storage network.**

**Simple explanation:**
- Traditional storage: Files on one company's servers (Google, Dropbox, etc.)
- IPFS: Files distributed across thousands of computers worldwide
- No single point of failure
- Content can't be censored or taken down
- Free and open source

### Q: Where are my files actually stored?

**A: On IPFS nodes around the world.**

When you upload:
1. File is broken into chunks

**A: Only partially.**

**Offline (no internet):**
- ‚ùå Can't upload new files
- ‚ùå Can't search your archive
- ‚úÖ Can use some local commands

**Online (with internet):**
- ‚úÖ Full functionality

### Q: Is Etherith open source?

**A: Yes! You can view all the code.**
